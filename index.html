<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><strong>What does VisuAlly do?</strong><br>
VisuAlly allows you to generate AI images and videos using a curated selection of advanced AI models. You can upload photos, reference images, and text prompts to create or edit visual content.</p>

<p><strong>Do I need an account?</strong><br>
No additional account is required. Your subscription is handled through your Apple ID, and all processing is performed anonymously by Replicate.</p>

<p><strong>How is my data handled?</strong><br>
Uploaded images, reference photos, and generated outputs are temporarily processed by Replicate. They delete this data automatically after around one hour. We do not store your images or prompts.</p>

<p><strong>Why did my generation fail?</strong><br>
Some models can be sensitive to image size or prompt structure. If a generation fails, try reducing the image resolution or simplifying the prompt. If the issue continues, contact support.</p>

<p><strong>What models are supported?</strong><br>
VisuAlly includes over 80+ AI models for image creation, editing, upscaling, inpainting, face editing, and video generation. The model list may evolve over time as we adopt newer and better models.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a subscription?</strong><br>
Yes. VisuAlly offers subscription tiers for image and video generation. Each tier includes a monthly allowance of generations and access to all supported models.</p>

<p><strong>How do I report a bug or issue?</strong><br>
Please email a description of the problem and attach a screenshot if possible. You will receive a reply as soon as possible.<br>
